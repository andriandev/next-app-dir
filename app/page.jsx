      <p>
        Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by the
        private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with
        server-side rendering and static website generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains"
        advising it to developers when "building a server-rendered website with
        Node.js". Where traditional React apps can only render their content in
        the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include
        applications rendered on the server-side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel, which also
        maintains and leads its open-source development.
